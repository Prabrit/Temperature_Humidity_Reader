# Temperature and humidity reader by using arduino R3 and DHT11 

## Description:

This Arduino project provides a simple yet effective solution for monitoring real-time temperature and humidity levels using a DHT11 sensor. The collected data is displayed on a connected LCD screen, offering a clear and convenient way to keep track of environmental conditions.

**Key Features:**

* **DHT11 Sensor Integration:** Utilizes the versatile DHT11 sensor to accurately measure temperature and humidity values.
* **Arduino Microcontroller:** Leverages the powerful Arduino R3 microcontroller to process sensor data and control the LCD display.
* **LCD Display:** Presents the measured temperature and humidity readings in a user-friendly format on an attached LCD screen.
* **Flexibility:** Can be easily adapted to various applications, such as home automation, weather stations, or data logging systems.
